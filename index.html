    <title>Persona 5 Royal Fuion Calculator</title>
    <meta name="description" content="This fusion calculator is designed to let the user search through all potential recipes for a given Persona and filter them by inheritable skills. All valid recipes will be sorted by cost. If a recipe's components don't innately know a skill, but can themselves be fused to learn it, the user can click on the icon next to their name to open another tab to learn how to pass that skill down.">
